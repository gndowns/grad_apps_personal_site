# About Me

**Hi I'm Gabriel Downs**. 
I work as a Data Science Intern at [Tactio Health Group](https://www.tactiohealth.com/en) in Montreal, Canada.
I recently graduated McGill University with an Honours in Math and Computer Science.
Previously, I worked in Computer Vision research under [Professor Kaleem Siddiqi](http://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~siddiqi/) in the Shape Analysis Group at Centre for Intelligent Machines.

My Current research interests include machine learning namely used for computer vision and natural langauge processing. 
I am also personally interested in formal language design, both for programming langauges and constructed human languages such as Esperanto. 


# Recent Projects

1. **[Scene Symmetry for CNNs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.10524)**: Humans use geometric cues such as symmetry to group visual elements into objects for recognition. I'm currently working with [Morteza Rezanejad](http://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~morteza/) to determine if CNNs have the same bias for symmetry and geometry in general. Check out our latest [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.10524) on arXiv or some of our [code](https://github.com/mrezanejad/AOFSkeletons)!

2. **[Souvenir, a Virtual Memory Palace](http://souvenir-to-remember.herokuapp.com/)**: The memory palace is a common mnemonic device that takes advantage of your spatial memory, allowing you to complete seemingly superhuman memory tasks. This tool uses Google Maps Streetview to help beginners and memory champions alike visualize the process. Try the [demo](http://souvenir-to-remember.herokuapp.com/) or check out the [code](https://github.com/gndowns/souvenir)! This project won 1st place at YHack 2016.

3. **[Differential Drive Robot](https://github.com/gndowns/miniprojects)**: An arduino-based differential drive robot built for a McGill Robotics one-week competition.

4. **[Facebook Message Scraper](https://github.com/gndowns/ParseBook)**: A python script to scrape and parse your facebook message data into a single, organized json object. Anyone can download their complete message history from facebook [directly](https://www.facebook.com/help/1701730696756992), but parsing of the data by this program allows for easier search and analysis of conversations. This code was written as part of a larger chatbot project which won 3rd place at the McHacks 2017 hackathon!

5. **[Ocaml to Javascript Transpiler](https://github.com/gndowns/yourFavouriteLanguage)**: A very simple demo of an Ocaml-javascript scanner and parser I made to study for a programming languages class at McGill. The grammar rules and parser are made with Jison, a javascript mock of GNU Bison.
