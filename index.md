# About Me

**Hi I'm Gabriel Downs**. I'm a 4th year undergrad student at McGill University finishing a Joint Honours in Math and Computer Science. I'm currently doing research under [Professor Kaleem Siddiqi](http://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~siddiqi/) in the Shape Analysis Group at Centre for Intelligent Machines.

My Current research interests include machine learning namely used for computer vision and natural langauge processing. I am also interested in language design, both for programming langauges and constructed human languages such as Esperanto. 

# Recent Projects

1. **Scene Symmetry for CNNs**: Humans use geometric cues such as symmetry to group visual elements into objects for recognition. I'm currently working with [Morteza Rezanejad](http://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~morteza/) to determine if CNNs have the same bias for symmetry and geometry in general.

2. **[Souvenir, a Virtual Memory Palace](http://souvenir-to-remember.herokuapp.com/)**: The memory palace is a common mnemonic device that takes advantage of your spatial memory, allowing you to complete seemingly superhuman memory tasks. This tool uses Google Maps Streetview to help beginners and memory champions alike visualize the process. Try the [demo](http://souvenir-to-remember.herokuapp.com/) or check out the [code](https://github.com/gndowns/souvenir)!.

3. **[Ocaml to Javascript Transpiler](https://github.com/gndowns/yourFavouriteLanguage)**: A very simple demo of an Ocaml-javascript scanner and parser I made to study for a programming languages class at McGill. The grammar rules and parser are made with Jison, a javascript mock of GNU Bison.

4. **[Differential Drive Robot](https://github.com/gndowns/miniprojects)**: An arduino-based differential drive robot built for a McGill Robotics one-week competition.
